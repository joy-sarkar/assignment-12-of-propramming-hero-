                With Ducati Unica, the Centro Stile Ducati opens its doors to
                Ducatisti and accompanies them in the realization of their
                dream: to collaborate directly with designers and technicians to
                create a motorcycle that will be a unique piece in the world.
                <br />
                Each stage of the creation of the bike will be documented and
                will see the involvement of enthusiasts, from the first sketches
                to the photos of delivery. With the support of Ducati
                professionals, the customization process will be outlined,
                defining every detail: precious materials, dedicated finishes,
                special colors and Ducati Performance accessories. All in
                compliance with the stylistic criteria that identify a real
                Ducati.
